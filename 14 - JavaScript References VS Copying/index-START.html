    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let copyPlayer = players

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let arr1 = new Array();
    players.forEach((el,idx)=>{
      arr1[idx] = el; 
    })
    console.log(arr1);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    arr2 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    arr1[0] = 'change'
    arr2[0] = 'change2'

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person1 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const person2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
